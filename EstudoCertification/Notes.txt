* When is assigned a safe list to a unsafe list like this ->
 List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
 List list2 = list1;
 you can do this -> list2.add(new Integer(0));  it will work, but as we can see it's too dangerous. so 
 watch out to code like this one.
 
 *Pay attention to when using a list like this List<? extends Something> you cannot add to the collection.
 
 *Remember that exclusive and inclusive regarding NavigableMap/Set return the start/end point if it's true or false 
 and when not specified this exclusive/inclusive flag it returns a SortedSet.
