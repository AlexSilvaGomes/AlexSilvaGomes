* When is assigned a safe list to a unsafe list like this ->
 List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<String>();
 List list2 = list1;
 you can do this -> list2.add(new Integer(0));  it will work, but as we can see it's too dangerous. so 
 watch out to code like this one.
 
 * Pay attention when using a list like this List<? extends Something> you cannot add to the collection.
